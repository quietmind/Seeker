Through our specially designed Interface, users are able to log, organize and study every step of the way. Features include a progress board for displaying the status of job applications, detail cards for hosting contact information, document hosting, data graphing of user progress, and more! Seeker users glean new insights to themselves as job candidates that can give them the competitive edge needed in the job market.
